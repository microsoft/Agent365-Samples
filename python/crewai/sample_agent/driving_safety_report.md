Driving Safety Assessment for Summer Tires in Current Conditions:

It is NOT SAFE to drive with summer tires in Dublin under these weather conditions.

Specific Reasons:
- Temperature: The air temperature is at the minimum threshold for summer tire grip (7°C), but the 'feels like' temperature is much colder (3.4°C), further reducing tire performance.
- Precipitation: Light rain with an 87% chance and heavy rainfall warning increase risk of hydroplaning and dramatically reduce summer tire traction. Wet roads pose danger due to limited water dispersion capabilities of summer tires.
- Road Conditions: High humidity and ongoing light rain guarantee consistently wet roads. Official weather warnings highlight flooding and difficult driving.
- Wind: Gusts up to 21 mph may affect vehicle stability, especially with reduced grip from summer tires.
- Visibility: Moderate visibility (8 km) can make it harder to spot hazards or respond quickly, increasing risk when tire performance is compromised.

Recommendation:
Switch to all-season or winter tires immediately for proper safety. Avoid driving with summer tires today, especially during heavy rain or warning periods. If you must drive, reduce speed significantly and increase all following distances. Monitor weather updates for improving conditions before resuming driving with summer tires.

Summary: Due to borderline cold temperatures, wet roads, active rainfall warning, and compromised visibility, driving with summer tires in Dublin today is unsafe and strongly discouraged.
