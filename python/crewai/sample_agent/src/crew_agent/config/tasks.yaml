driving_safety_task:
  description: >
    Based on the weather information provided, assess whether it is safe to drive
    with summer tires in {location}.
    
    Consider the following factors:
    - Temperature: Summer tires lose effectiveness below 7°C (45°F)
    - Precipitation: Rain, snow, or ice significantly reduce summer tire performance
    - Road conditions: Wet, icy, or snowy roads are dangerous with summer tires
    - Wind conditions: High winds can affect vehicle stability
    - Visibility: Poor visibility affects overall driving safety
    
    Provide a clear safety assessment with specific reasons based on the weather data.
    
    If the user requested an email, YOU are responsible for sending ONE email that includes:
    1. The complete weather report from the previous task
    2. Your driving safety assessment
    Combine both into a single comprehensive email. Do NOT send multiple emails.
    Use the SendEmailWithAttachmentsAsync tool to send the email directly (do NOT use draft tools).
  expected_output: >
    A clear safety assessment stating whether it's safe to drive with summer
    tires in the current weather conditions, along with specific reasons and any
    recommendations or warnings. Format as a clear decision with supporting details.
    If an email was requested, confirm it was sent (only once, with combined content).
