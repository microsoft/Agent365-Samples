# Agent 365 Sample Agent - .NET Semantic Kernel

This directory contains a sample agent implementation using .NET and Semantic Kernel, hosted on an ASP.NET Core web service. This agent will handle multiple "turns" to get the required information from the user.

This Agent Sample is intended to introduce you to the basics of integrating Agent 365 and Semantic Kernel with the Microsoft 365 Agents SDK in order to build powerful Agents. It can also be used as the base for a custom Agent that you choose to develop.

## Demonstrates

This sample demonstrates how to build an agent using the Agent 365 framework with .NET and Semantic Kernel. It shows the three key Agent 365 concepts; Notifications, Observability, and Tooling, and shows how by combining these concepts, powerful scenarios can be unlocked.
